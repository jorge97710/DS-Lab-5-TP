Chad has been awesome with the kids and holding down the fort while I work later than usual! The kids have been busy together playing Skylander on the XBox together, after Kyan cashed in his $$$ from his piggy bank. He wanted that game so bad and used his gift card from his birthday he has been saving and the money to get it (he never taps into that thing either, that is how we know he wanted it so bad). We made him count all of his money to make sure that he had enough! It was very cute to watch his reaction when he realized he did! He also does a very good job of letting Lola feel like she is playing too, by letting her switch out the characters! She loves it almost as much as him.
so anyways, i am going to share some home decor inspiration that i have been storing in my folder on the puter. i have all these amazing images stored away ready to come to life when we get our home.
With graduation season right around the corner, Nancy has whipped up a fun set to help you out with not only your graduation cards and gifts, but any occasion that brings on a change in one's life. I stamped the images in Memento Tuxedo Black and cut them out with circle Nestabilities. I embossed the kraft and red cardstock with TE's new Stars Impressions Plate, which is double sided and gives you 2 fantastic patterns. You can see how to use the Impressions Plates in this tutorial Taylor created. Just one pass through your die cut machine using the Embossing Pad Kit is all you need to do - super easy!

Other friends have similar stories, of how they were treated brusquely by Laurelwood staff, and as often as not, the same names keep coming up. About a half-dozen friends of mine refuse to step foot in there ever again because of it. How many others they’re telling - and keeping away - one can only guess.
Although our beloved Cantab can’t claim the international recognition afforded the Station Inn, otherwise these two joints feel like twins separated by nothing more than distance.

Peter Schiff: Hard to tell. It will look pretty bad for most Americans when prices will go way up and they can’t afford to buy stuff. It could also get very bad as far as loss of individual liberty. A lot of people will blame it on capitalism, on freedom, and they will claim we need more government. It could be used as an impetus for more regulation, which would be a disaster, or it could be an impetus to get rid of all the regulation that was causing the problem. But whether we will do the right or the wrong thing here in America, there will be a lot of pain first. We got some serious problems we have to deal with, but we are not dealing with the problems, we only make the problems worse.
3. Winter is the time when all sleeps on some level. It is a time of turning within to make contact with your own innermost being. Winter is the best time to do this and, as a result, get answers for yourself about whatever concerns you. It is also a tremendously creative time, a time for artists of all kinds to turn within and to seek images of forms he or she wishes to produce in whatever medium chosen, so that an image of balance can be presented. Those of you that write, we suggest that you do so to come up with plots and ideas that will speak of balance coming to an imbalanced situation, person, or world. To those of you who, like Priscilla, work with making patterns and designs, we would say remember the images and designs brought about by winter. White will challenge you to see what changes will manifest in the images you produce. We ask that you do this in your own environment.
I am en-route to Cornwall again. 3/4 months of slog and sun and sea too. Always a job needs doing in a tourist town. I’m bringing my stuff back from 97 on Friday. Will need to cancel bills before I retreat. Not such a bad thing. Moved to Leeds with promise from Millies. That went nowhere. Move on.

The one thing that was astounding though was the support from the marshals – they were all phenomenal for being out in the rain for so long and remaining so cheery and supportive. They were an amazing bunch. Owing to the nature of the course and very few closed roads meant that supporters who knew the area were able to skip around the course and a few people were seen about 5 or 6 times which was also super!!

A neighbor recommended “Chasing Fireflies” by Charles Martin. I’d never read anything by Martin before, although he was this neighbor’s favorite author. “Fireflies” is the story of Chase, a journalist who never knew his parents and was adopted by “Unc,” a colorful resident of a small Georgia town whose sayings and kind heart make him a memorable character. Chase is investigating the story of another orphan, this one a mute boy pushed out of a car on train tracks just before a train hit and killed his loser custodial “parent.”

Either Obama/Congress, etc. give in or, more likely, refuse. The group announces that the next device will be detonated in a populated area, with no warning. Again, “Obama,” et al., refuse to submit. This time the device is detonated in a mid-sized to major city. Tens of thousands die. (Think the atomic bombs that ended WWII.)
April was a month for new beginnings. Firstly, I finally finished my exams, and if all is good, I’ll be graduating in May. It still feels weird to know that the business degree I’ve been working for four years is finally mine. So now I’m in the process of looking for a new job. Secondly, I finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years, and that’s a bit nerve-wrecking. As for reading books, the last week of April gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories. As you will see, I have not finished much, but I have successfully began several hefty novels. I am happy with the progress I’ve made so far and the quality of books I’ve picked to read. The Fellowship of the Ring is surprisingly easy to read, considering all my fears about Tolkien and his writing. I am loving A Clash of Kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot. Master and Margarita is my first Russian novel in a long time, and I have to say it’s surprisingly refreshing. I had to postpone my Virginia Woolf experience for later, as I find that I am just not in the mood for it. I should be returning to it a bit later.

When I was four years of age I remember being at home with my mom one day when a salesman tried breaking into our home. My mom was on the phone to her sister when the guy tried every door in the house. Her and I was curled up in a corner of the kitchen hiding with the phone hoping the guy would leave. It scarred me. I have never been trusting of them since this and I haven’t had one that has changed my mind.

Let’s say hypothetically, there is a bomb threat inside an airport. And there is only 10 minutes remaining it will explode. Inside the building there are few whites, blacks and Asian/middle eastern descents. And one of them has the code to disarm the bomb. So what would law enforcement do in a situation like this? Conduct a random check? Or eliminate the best possibilities by checking the Middle Eastern people first? If there are statistics and reasons to believe that threat comes from a certain race, is it unlawful to profile them? If a white man goes on a killing spree then should we waste time checking black men? Same goes to blacks or any other race. Isn’t it simple and smart to stay on facts and statistics or waste time and money by trying to be politically right?

I have it on good authority that everyone in this company, particularly the strikers, recieved gifts in the company-organised Secret Santa. I also know that the strikers attended the company-funded Xmas Party, where they partook in the company-funded luncheon. They also recieved vouchers to the value of K100, from the company as Xmas gifts.
I've also pondered a more permanent solution that involves several smaller chronological blogrolls organized by blog type (like the color codes). But that seems like a lot of work to create and maintain, and I'm not sure it would be helpful to the reader.

How many times have you heard someone say that so-and-so is too nice to tell the person they’re seeing that they want to call it quits, too nice to address unfair working conditions with their employer or too nice to ask someone to stop using that seat on the subway as a foot stool? There certainly are people who are soft-spoken and decidedly non-confrontational. But that doesn’t mean they’re nicer relative to everyone else. It’s just their personality. You can be assertive, honest and even outspoken and still be a very nice person.

On The Lovin’ People, he has the benefit of a good backing band consisting of Pretty Purdie on drums, Artie Butler on organ & piano, and Joe Mack and Bill Salter on bass. The band, who play both loose and funky without ever sounding sloppy, helped produce a more laid back vibe and Chandler sounds more relaxed than he did on the earlier album. He has some better songs on this one, too, such as the title cut warm, poppy number about...well, “Lovin’ People,” on which the presence of a chorus (made up on the spot of people who had gathered to provide assistance to a mothers’ help organization) also helps temper Chandler’s unfortunate tendency towards over-earnestness. “The Naked Fool” is about a relationship gone bad, which doesn’t have anything new to say but will have a few toes tapping. “Sold Out, No More Reservations” is an interesting number about a male groupie, and “Bound to Fly” has a nice soaring quality, and Chandler’s lyrics and delivery mesh well on it. If anything the problem here is that Chandler is sometimes eclipsed by his backing band—check “Behind Your Eyes” where the band goes off on some nice free jazz-psychedelic tangents while Chandler seems to be trying to channel Sammy Davis, Jr.
I was worried I wasn’t going to like this. And not because I have an unhealthy love of comic book heroes and unrealistic expectations. No, I was worried because it seems the 98% of people I know had already seen it and enjoyed it. Even the wife. Thus, wading in with an opinion of ‘pfft…shite’ would prove about as popular as punching a kitten in the face. But in the end the fears proved unfounded as I really did like it.

Ah, Parga. How many times have we sat in Paxos, looking across at the mainland at night seeing twinkling lights in the far distance? How many times have we wondered just what was it like over there? Well now we know. Unfortunately the place with the twinkling lights was not Parga but some other little community. We got it wrong. Parga was on the itinerary anyway. We concluded it was not worth the detour; two resort-y bays separated by an ancient Turkish fort on a steep hill and a cluster of souvenir shops, tavernas and restaurants. The marina was unwelcoming - we moored alongside a rusting, capsized ferry - and the trudge to buy some provisions took us along a neglected rubbish strewn track. Thomas would not leave the boat for fear we were robbed. But hey! Pull up the gangplank, crack open a beer and experiment with cooking in the galley.

I napped after studio class tonight. Andrew and I were up really late last night, despite going to bed at a somewhat decent time. We ended up talking to each other for about an hour and a half to two hours just about our lives and what was going on and stuff like that. It was a very nice talk, but it made me tired for today, which explains why I’m still awake now. But don’t worry…I’ll be getting to bed shortly, right after I shower.

Smokers I have little sympathy for – you made that decision, in the face of all the evidence that it’s not just seriously harmful to you, but to everyone around you, so I’m sorry, but you get to live with the consequences. And had I not lived, worked and socialised among smokers for most of my life, until the ban, I wouldn’t be anywhere near as ill as I am now, so sympathy is in very short supply.

I recently tried a super fabulous restaurant that you MUST MUST try. I usually don't give restaurant recommendations, so trust me on this one. I decided to go down to South Norwalk and check out The SoNo Baking Company and Cafe that Martha Stewart is always yammering on about on Martha. This tiny hidden jewel was started by John Barricelli, who works for Martha and also hosts Everyday Baking on PBS. It is Fa. Bu. Lous. Seriously, that good. We had lunch and I tried a Cobb Salad that elevated the usual blah salad to a culinary masterpiece. I sat at the counter in front of a huge glass window and watched people roll out chocolate croissants with a vintage roller while I ate. (If you are a big geek, that is a huge thrill.) At one point in the meal, I actually saw John Barricelli through the glass instructing one of the bakers on how to place the chocolate chunks perfectly in the croissant. I considered banging on the glass to blow kisses and get my photo taken with him but I decided I had done that enough recently with both her and her, so I decided to play it cool and just eat my lunch quietly. I also brought home a huge selection of pastries and enjoyed every single one (in the name of research, not gluttony, mind you). John is coming out with a cookbook in early March. You can be a geek like me and pre-order your copy on Amazon today. The cafe is located right near the South Norwalk Aquarium and makes a good drive on a cold winter's day.

Of course it goes without saying that all the music above would probably have been familiar to Gardel's audience, too. But it's not that widely known here. It's not difficult or inaccessible music, but it's not a routine part of the popular culture in the same way that it would have been when Gardel was playing El dia que mi quieras, or even as it was when my grandmother's relations were making their own entertainment in Australia with performances of Bizet's Au fond du temple saint.

Valentines Day falls on February 14th each year. It is a holiday in which lovers express said love for each other, traditionally with flowers, candle lit dinners, heart shaped things, chocolate and greeting cards. The first Valentines cards were hand written but over time have made way for more mass produced greetings. These cards, for the most part, depict images of hearts, cupids and love struck victims.

Roughly a week later, my sister and her ever-expanding family drove in from Alaska and picked me up, and then we all headed on to Alvin, Texas, once a happy place where a son would be reunited with his father, but now a haunted little town where ghosts of memories reared their teeth at every turn. We pulled into the driveway at dusk, greeted by my stepmother and stepbrother, both of who appeared to be much stronger than me.

The product is a milky white liquid that applies like emulsion, not too creamy and thick, but not like water (or jelly) either. After spreading it out on your face, it dries within a few minutes. After which the fun begins! According to the SA, after it dries, you start rubbing it like you’re trying to rub dirt off your face, until you rub off most of it. If required, wash off the remaining with lukewarm water. So I started rubbing and it actually takes quite a bit of effort to rub it all off! It comes off in little bits like you’re rubbing off a layer of your skin.

Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, at the end of the kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision.
I have mixed emotions about the start to this book. As I’ve already mentioned I very much enjoyed the characters and the voice of the protagonist. But as much as I was enjoying it, it took me a little while to get into the story. We’re presented with a huge case of insta-love right from the start. Lucas, the mysterious and hot new neighbor, comes on strong. I’m pretty sure they start making out on their second or third meeting! I’m warning you now. There’s not a lot of rationalization for the insta-love…you won’t really understand the reasons until the end of the book. Which is why, in retrospect, I kinda like that I had to wait for all of the info to be revealed.

Sometimes, I just want to read a book. It’s kinda like Freud said, “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” Well in my case, sometimes I just need to read an actual hard or soft cover book, feel the paper against my fingers, smell the newness or musty oldness. If it’s a new book, there is something quite satisfying about being the first one to crack it open. I love to turn the pages, hear the crinkle and switch as my fingers brush against the paper.

I think I did three sets of revisions in the end. The first involved clarifying the plot. I kept moving away from the main thread and rambling in different directions. Once I’d mastered that I had to switch some chapters round and cut some bits out then work a little on the dialogue. Plotting has been the most difficult part of writing so far. But through writing Shine, I studied plot hard, learned a lot and with my second book, Glitter, due out on Sept. 2nd, I had one small amount of editing to do. I kept waiting for Rachel to send the MS back with more to do when I discovered it was already with the copyeditor!

This stuff is actually happening. It’s threatening our survival. And it’s not just the environment. And I’m writing it to know that, among the peaceful: you are not crazy for thinking that we are approaching a turning point in our country where the realities of decades of profit-over-all-else mentality are becoming not just undeniable, but are confronting us in our day to day lives in ways we did not think was possible in a country that now seems, in retrospect, to have been the least Western, least democratically-minded country to be considered so. And that turning point might require widespread civil disobedience, in the name of the environmental and economic survival of our country and our people (as well, of course, as the vast masses like us all around the world, in other countries).

There came a point, maybe three years into that, where I began to realise I'd have to have another go at a novel. Giant Thief didn't originate with any one story, but it did come out of not wanting to make the mistakes I'd made with my first attempt at novel writing. I was writing one or two short stories a month, and I didn't want to lose that pace. So it had to be something fast-paced, fun, not too convoluted. Something I could throw myself into and just keep moving with.

In reporting on activities to Chloe, I invented the chick-flick scale, my very own movie rating system. Instead of stars, chick flicks get 1 to 4 hearts (of course). Here are mini reviews of the movies I've watched this past week or so.

Alyssa is now 10 and has been busy with Volleyball, Girlscouts, and Sunday School. It seems like we are always running with her somewhere. She was struggling in reading in school a few months back, and was put into special reading help class; which was in turn taking time away from her math time and causing her to struggle in math; but she has now caught up with her reading, and has turned her math skills around as well. Conferences are just around the corner, and we have high hopes for her. We repainted her room for her last Birthday and gave her all new bedding and furniture. She has more things in her room, than time to play with the stuff...but what kid doesn't I guess.We don't get to see her as much as we would like to, but we cherish the time we do get with her. We have a lot of fun things planned to do with her on the weekends we have with her, let's hope we don't wear her out!
The concept of the King's Peace first appeared during the reign of Richard I in 1195. Peace was henceforth to be seen as the responsibility of the king, and its breach required that the culpable parties be answerable to him. During the reign of Edward III in 1361, Justices of the Peace were appointed for the first time. The Crown, in effect, was claiming a monopoly on violence in the realm, and appointing officials to enforce it.
The black sports coat, white button-up shirt, khaki slacks, and leather loafers he wore were all tailored and very expensive giving the impression of him being some sort of major player in the world trying to lay low and relax. It was a thought that Peter was beginning to believe more and more about himself as his sales numbers rocketed into orbit.
After the war memorial, and Northwood Station, we turned right just after St Helen's School towards Northwood Hills. My two South London colleagues were pleased that there actually was a hill. We were surprised at the number of closed-down shops in this apparently affluent area, but the William Jolle pub still seemed to be thriving. (Because it is a Wetherspoons establishment, I can tell you that he was a local 14th century resident) The former pub opposite had, however, metamorphosed into the Namaste Lounge.

The only not-so-fabulous part was that as I was getting the monkeys in the tub, I started to sneeze. And feel drippy and tickly. Sure signs of an end-of-summer cold. Bluck. I feel icky this morning, but have too much to do to be sick. So I am refusing to succumb to my desire to plop on the couch and sniff all day. I am hoping sheer will alone will heal me :)
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for teaching me to prayer earnest, heartfelt and continued prayers. As I spend time to pray like this today, Your divine power is manifested, changes are effected, and circumstances in my life are changed, in Jesus Christ Name I pray! Amen!
Last week, he was so worked up about some things that were not actually real. He laid down in his bed and kept going over and over them with me. I told him he just needed to relax, that he didn't need to worry so much. He is being so well cared for. He gave me the silent soul searching steel blue stare, softly grabbed my hand, and said, "I'll always remember you."

From Peru, we flew to Ecuador and then on to the wedding. After the celebrations, we were off to Hawaii, for a much needed relaxing beach holiday, after which we did a wonderful cruise of The Great Barrier Reef, before flying home via Singapore. What a great trip that was, and one day I’ll put some more photos up for you to see.
I gave Nick S a call before I got there and he told me that Tim CC was on his way up to get it, so I did a quick pass 500' over a couple of pilots on takeoff, then headed back over Aber.
This race is a top-notch way to break into the triple digits for the first time. That’s why I keep coming back and I always bring others with me. The volunteers are wonderful. The food and support system is exceptional. And the race direction is flawlessly efficient. Joe Prusaitis certainly knows how to put on a quality event! Those of us that stuck around for the award ceremony brought home a special Texas Trinket for being one of the most interesting out-of-town groups.

When it comes to making my own salsas at home, I've often limited myself to making the usual salsas that involve fresh tomatoes, fresh jalapenos, an onion, some cilantro and a bit of lime juice... or pico de gallo. And from time to time, I may make the salsa verde, guacamole, or the black bean and corn salsa.... even the quick, budget-friendly avocado sauce. They are all excellent. But recently I managed to make 2 different salsas, opening the door to a new way of making salsa for me... using various chiles to add depth and flavor.

That’s why there’s cache. Cache-memory access is almost as fast as register access, but you can have a lot of cache memory—comparatively. L1 caches typically have 32 or 64Kbyte capacities and often there are independent caches for instructions and data. Caches take a huge load off main memory, relieving the pressure to speed up main-memory access.
“When one has seen one house he has seen them all, the same everlasting high stoops and gloomy brown-stone fronts, the same number of holes punched in exactly the same places,” Osman quotes a late 19th century writer as lamenting. “The new brownstone and trolley grid inspired 19th century eulogies for a real and imagined agricultural landscape,” Osman writes.
Anyway, Howl is the dashing wizard that Sophie fell in love with. He was self-absorbed. In the movie it was said that Howl’s heart was young and immature (something like that). At first he wasn’t capable of loving anyone. I guess to be able to understand the film, we have to understand Howl’s relationship with Calcifer.

The message of Journey of the Universe shows how we are not just a part of this astonishing process, we are at the very edge of evolution, a primate species that has found in its language and symbols the power to take over the very evolutionary process itself. But this control that we now exercise comes with a responsibility; and viewers of Journey of the Universe will not only be imbued with a sense of astonishment at all that has taken place, they will also come to feel the excitement in learning that now we live in a time when the human species is being asked to play a central role in activating the flourishing powers of Earth’s living systems.
They are both chunky knits and were a complete bargain-the green was £1 and the multi colour knit was £2!! The charity shops have now started putting out their winter stocks so using these knits as inspiration, why don't you go and hunt down a stylish cosy bargain for much less than the high street or designer versions?

Freddie did spend some time in Vietnam too; I think he told us he used to make maps there. But we never pushed it because who knew if he would “Freak out” about it. And Freddie knew just about everything you know, politics, art, religion, history, philosophy, and most important, Brooklyn.

Again, I’ve just begun working on what Mr. Licata told me and I’ll post more later but if its true, it would make a great book: corrupt lawyers, bribed judges and completely crooked bankers engaging in mortgage fraud and outright theft. Real estate slows down from about the end of May and won’t really resume until September so maybe I’ll devote some of that free time to writing this up – it’s got the ingredients for a great tale.
I was recently given the assignment to select one word that describes me and write about it. At first this sounded so simple, but in my usual fashion I spent a little too much time dwelling over it. I wear many badges. I am a wife, a mother, a daughter, a teacher, a friend....you get my point. The word that returned to me most often and a word I've never used to describe myself was pray-er, a person that prays. I questioned if it was really a word...it is...I looked it up. It is seldom used, but it is a word.
It's official, I made the 2012 Spellbinders team. It's been an amazing year and I am so glad that it doesn't have to end. I love this company, their products, their values, and the people who make Spellbinders what it is.
Or at least, the US does. Why don’t things like this exist? Adults like to have fun as much as kids do, although maybe the urge to play has either died down naturally or been repressed by responsibilities. Playgrounds are a great way for kids to run, jump, and get some exercise while enjoying themselves, but what like that exists for adults? If you want fun, it’s usually either expensive or relatively sedentary like walking or hiking. If you want cheap exercise … lace up those running shoes. (And I don’t deny that some people gain enjoyment from running, but I sure don’t.)
And the paint. I have read every blog and article on the web that discusses painting cabinets and I tried something completely different from what I had read. Have you seen those commercials for Behr "He is painting while he primes. She is priming while she paints?" I went for the premium primer included stuff from Home Depot. The black color is Behr Beluga. I painted 3 coats, sanding lightly between each one. I didn't remove the doors but I easily could (and probably should) have. I decided to distress them. This my husband wasn't too thrilled about but I know how my kids and their stool had already distressed them over the years so I figured I would save myself the headache and heartache and have them start distressed. I hit it several places with the sander and then used a darker tinted glaze (some watered down acrylic craft paint) over the sanded spots to darken up the distressed areas.
I’m pretty late to the LCD Soundsystem party (a great oversight on my part), but thankfully rectified with Mr James Murphy’s third (and final?) outing of liquid crystal disco. It sounds effortlessly cool, but there’s so much going on, it’s just plain fun to listen to, dance to and do just about anything to – be it the washing up, filling out an application form or being attacked by PANDUHS!

During this time, peaceful occupiers have been faced with continual harassment arrests, almost invariably on fabricated charges (“disorderly conduct,” “interfering with the conduct of a police officer”—the latter a charge that can be leveled, for instance, against those who try to twist out of the way when an officer is hitting them.) I have seen one protestor at Union Square arrested, by four officers using considerable force, for sitting on the ground to pet a dog; another, for wrapping a blanket around herself (neither were given warnings; but both behaviors were considered too close to “camping”); a third, an ex-Marine, for using obscene language on the Federal steps. Others were reportedly arrested on those same steps for singing a satirical version of the “Officer Krumpke” song from West Side Story. Almost no march goes by without one or two protestors, at least, being hurled against vehicles or have their heads bashed against the ground while being arrested for straying off the sidewalk. The message here is clear. Law has nothing to do with it. Anyone who engages in Occupy Wall Street-related activity should know they can be arrested, for virtually any reason, at any time.

I'm a voracious reader. Always have been. As a teenager, my parents ended up having to hide my books so I would get my chores done because I would spend every chance I got reading. It didn't really change when I had a family, except no one had to hide my books so I'd get my chores done. :P

I'm in the process of building out an entire enchanted forest in one inch scale as part of my set for the Myrtle short film. Trees complete with faces and jelly jars hanging from the branches filled with fireflies / will o' the wisps. It's starting to look pretty good and I'm pleased with how the glass jars light up. They're all hand-blown glass and less than 1 cm in height. So like me, this project is pretty teeny.

Data-mining programs will provide these abusers of power with powerful tools for creating enemies lists, and for targeting them, as described in EFAD. Social media networks are already under intensive federal scrutiny. This year, it is ostensibly to track down undefined terrorist threats. But social media, so popular today, must be understood as a two-edged sword. The same social media that facilitated the Arab Spring, today brings the secret police of Syria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other nations to the doors of obscure bloggers hidden in tiny apartments, to drag them away to secret torture cells.
I was walking back from my girlfriend’s house through Park South, a notoriously run-down area of Swindon, riddled with unemployment, anti-social behaviour and crime. It’s not the area of Swindon I normally associate with a ‘passion for politics’, but as I crossed the water logged field I saw a purple and yellow glow from a window. ‘VOTE UKIP’. Wait, what? – This took me by surprise, Park South has always been a Labour stronghold, we have all seen it in the media that the ‘smaller’ parties are going to do well tomorrow, but this really hit home for me. It’s bitter-sweet.

Due to the nature of my job (raising children) I find my cleaning standards have slipped somewhat. After a day spent washing up, sweeping food off the kitchen floor, wiping all the surfaces, picking up toys and random objects up off every floor in the house, cooking, looking after my kids, making beds, and hanging washing out, seventeen times over, I have no remaining energy to do any actual cleaning.

But wait, broadcast industry opponents say. Aren’t broadcasters the rich and powerful few disenfranchising the rest of the country from having ubiquitous wireless broadband? Only they won’t say it quite like that, but the point is worth examining. Just 10 to 15 percent of U.S. households rely exclusively on over-the-air television. There is some evidence of cord-cutting–i.e., people ditching pay service for free TV–but not to the extent to suggest that ratio will double anytime soon. And we don’t know much yet about the adoption rate of mobile over-the-air TV because where is it already?
Our system is broken. Government serves the interest of big business and big business only serves the interest of a very few, wealthy elites. It’s time to make our economy and our politics work for working people.

I've got to admit that I didn't know the Norfolk Broads was water, for some reason I just imagined it being fields. We learned little bits about it along the way, like they're man-made, but I did a bit more research here and have learned that the Broads is now the UK's largest nationally protected wetland. They are a man-made creation, formed when people dug for peat! Who knew?

I rode from my house to RC1's house and when I was just about there I came to a place in the trail where it stopped suddenly with friendly 'no trespassing' signs suggesting that I find another route. Instead, I picked up my bike and crossed the rail road tracks anyway. That experience loosely parallels my week. Pushing forward, creating my own path... That or a silly rummycube analogy about switching around the tiles until they fit just right. I like thinking in metaphor.
The juices today were the best yet. Breakfast was like a chilled, spiced carrot soup and lunch was like a thin salsa. Plus I had the Chocolate Nut Milk again for dinner because it was so enjoyable last night.

The morning was HARSH. Anytime I completely lose it to that extent (see yesterdays posts), I always wake up feeling like I got ran over by a semi-truck. My body did NOT want to move and I hurt SO bad. I was late getting DD to school, but I got her there. And from that point on……I’m pretty sure Hell froze over.
The wisdom of the world is still foolish today. One of the great discussion topics of our age is how we get to heaven. The pervasive world view is that everybody will get there some day depending on what you’re looking for. The world’s view claims it doesn’t matter which path you follow to get there. Many in the world’s intellectual and scientific communities believe heaven and hell don’t even exist. We who are being saved, however, know that Jesus would not have gone to the cross if He did not know there was something beyond this world. Those of us who are being saved also know human wisdom costs a person everything, but Godly wisdom affords us everything.

We’ll have faith because we’re clean — not just because of what Jesus did — but because we lived in Him, righteous, by His grace we overcame. We didn’t shrink back. We made sure that we stayed right with Him. We’re supposed to walk like Jesus walked. We can’t just do our own thing and think it’s okay because of some formula. “Without holiness, no man will see God.”

Of course, there’s a moral to this tale ~ a little piece of wisdom that you can apply to your own stay in the transitional zone of Veterans Campus. And that moral is: if you don’t like the roommate you got now, don’t worry. Be happy.

Armadillo came about because I wanted to see more review space for children's books.

Twice a week she will go over to a school near our house and work with the specialist. They can increase it or decrease it, if needed. The lady who does it, is a member we know from our local pool, so that was nice seeing a friendly face. She told me I look just like Betty Draper from Mad Men. This made me laugh, and I felt the need to tell her I didn't drink or smoke while pregnant with Emily, like Betty did. This lady can be my BFF though for thinking I look like her though.

Soon after making his Kennedy Center debut, Mr. Requiro also completed the cycle of Beethoven’s Sonatas for Piano and Cello at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. Actively involved in contemporary music, he has collaborated with composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Bright Sheng and most recently gave the Dutch premier of Pierre Jalbert’s Sonata for cello and piano at the 2010 Amsterdam Cello Biennale.

SXSW: The roller coaster ride of SXSW is not well recorded. Lines, crowds, and an ass load of crappy bands can make you anxious. You are watching the third mediocre band of the night. You want to leave, but your friends like the band. You go to see your "can't miss pick of the night". There's a line. You wait for 15 minutes. You give up and wander. You try not to be pissed. You make a random call: "The Red Eyed Fly always has good Kharma for bands". You stop in to find the drunkest bunch of musicians you've ever seen playing the most kick ass gypsy music ever. A beer distributor gives you a free beer to "try" it. You've had it before, but pretend not to. You call your friends to come over cause "it kicks ass". Life is good.

And every single day I remember what a dumbass I am for thinking I can beat the odds, that I won't be thinking unkind thoughts about whomever caused the accident that has resulted in the bumper to bumper clusterfuck that is the worst commute in the nation. I lament the fact that they don't have formal drivers' education here, that the public transportation system is pretty much nonexistent and, of course, I berate myself for once again for forgetting that the back roads aren't just more scenic. They're more efficient, too.
Cake is always a very big party of wedding days, with that being said I've only ever eaten cake at one friends wedding and that is simply because it was forced down my throat by the groom. Odd, yes but it was a prank the Bride and Groom tried to play on myself and the bestman. I saw the prank coming a mile away and mouthed to the Bestman to "Duck!" he didn't understand and as I ducked and ran he got cake smashed in his face by the bride. The groom then chased me down and around the dance floor finally tackling me and giving me cake. Thankfully he and I are very close friends or I might have been really pissed not only at my bride/bff but at him too. Most weddings I go to I'm too busy dancing, or drinking to care about sweets, so while I was excited about planning my cake for my own wedding - I wasn't really concerned about eating it.

Southend has suffered from its reputation as a place of down-market entertainment. The fun-fair atmosphere lends credence to this, persuading the snobs that this is not a place to visit, much less to be seen in, but I think that does Southend less than justice. There is more to the place than pubs, fish and chips and games arcades. In any case, I rather think that the merry chink of money in the tills removes any concerns about what the snobs think.

Working in the tech environment that we do with creative advertising types you would expect to see a lot of iPods, digital camera’s and laptops. And you do. But I kind of always assumed that it was because of the environment.

Not content with charging enormous up-front sums for leases on the pubs they own, the big pub chains have the nerve to then charge rent for the premises on top of that. They also dictate that the lessor "keep the standard of the pub up to their specification", so that a publican is not even allowed to decorate his own pub without their approval.
My party is a Hostess Appreciation Tea which is actually on my schedule for June. I can't wait to make the Creativity Journals with my sweet guests.

After so many incidents in which Palestinian propaganda has managed to rearrange the narrative so that the Israeli side appears to be the aggressor, we could expect the IDF brass, as well as Israel’s government, to show restraint, perhaps count to 30, before throwing their own man under the media bus. But, alas, both IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned a senior IDF officer for the way he appears on a selectively edited Palestinian video on You Tube.

Noticing is what effected change for Simba in The Lion King. The voice of his father echoing from the past at last reminded him of that which he had long forgotten to pay attention to—his heart, his purpose, and his true identity. As he chose to be responsive to the truth, he was able to face his fears and return to the Pride Lands with a new perspective.
I ultimately reminded myself that all of our circumstances are different. I really know nothing about these people. Maybe their children were older and working independently when they became single moms. Maybe they didn’t start off their single parenthood with no money. Maybe they have grandparents nearby who help out. Maybe they didn’t move to a foreign country where they have no work history the year before they became single parents. Who knows. All I can focus on is where my situation is right now and how to best handle it.

I’ve been told by more than one person that I have the mouth of a sailor. Some of my favorite expletives involve a combination of the words “hairy,” “ballsack,” and “wrinkly.” This didn’t come naturally for me. I had to work at it, practice my trade, experiment with new combinations. I’ve worked very hard to have a mouth even the British Orbit lady couldn’t clean up.
During our visit Iceland was unseasonably cold. It was so cold in fact that we purchased an extra layer at Iceland's own 66°N so we could withstand the coldness. Being on a boat only amplified that and we had to remember that this is summer.

“I have worked for 40 years, paid taxes for 40 years and paid NI for 40 years. I have been on DLA for 6 years and if I were still able to work I would still be on £40,000 pa and have a company car instead of a Motorbility car. I would travel the country using my first class rail warrant and stay in 4* hotels using my generous expense account. I had dignity, self belief, respect and I loved my job. However, it would seem that one day I decided to become disabled, poverty stricken and treated like a criminal. As a life style choice it was a disaster! Now it seems I am guilty of attempted fraud, worthless, a burden on society and a waste of space. Does anybody really believe that I prefer my life now? Drug addicts, while also needing help, are treated with more compassion and they made an informed choice to start using. I did not choose to be this way and I expect to be given as much support.” Derek Benyon, Leicestershire; sick for 7 years
I recently cancelled my cable (for the second time) due to escalating costs and a general disgust at the lack of quality programming. I won’t lie and say I’ve never indulged in reality smut for entertainment. I have caught myself watching Bachelor Pad and no part of me is proud of it. It is the “train-wreck” factor that keeps people paying attention to most of the stuff that passes for good TV.
I told by boss my leaving date this week and put the rumours to rest. Clients naturally got told first, but news travels fast with only a matter of weeks to go and soon everyone knew. condolences and wishes of good luck come flooding in, the work floods in and dries up at the same time – it is a funny one.

We had a conference with the neonatologist this afternoon and he said that her breathing issues are a result of her prematurity and she would need to stay in the NICU until she is able to breathe without assistance and keep her pulse ox in the 90s. This could take days or weeks, every baby is different.

I don’t mean to be disrespectful and I know that Mike Melvoin — who penned five tunes, including the New York songs, on the album and lends his considerable talents on piano — unfortunately passed away in February. But I can’t help feeling I’ve heard this all before. Basse is compared by some critics and the album’s publicity to Mel Torme, Ray Charles and Dr. John (Dr. John, really?) but in truth he’s a lot closer to Harry Connick, Jr. without as much sparkle and wit.

He may not always take part in our insane escapades or hang around the newsroom as much as we do, but I love Ryan too death. I know he’s all Arts and Entertainment now, but he can never forget where he started – an Assistant News Editor. There are very few people I would put money on, but Ryan is one of them. He’s not only going places, but he’s already gotten places. I’ve never seen anyone at the paper that can write a feature like this kid. He’s pretty awesome.

In itself, the tale of the publication of Into the Cannibal’s Pot: Lessons For America From Post-Apartheid South Africa bears telling. For while this polemic respects no political totems or taboos, it is faithful to facts. These facts cried out to be chronicled. They should not have had a struggle to find their way into print.
The victim’s friend, a young woman, tried to pull him back into his car. Attackers came after her, pulling her hair, punching her head and causing a bloody scratch to the surface of her eye. She called 911. A recording told her all lines were busy. She called again. Busy. On her third try, she got through and, hysterical, could scream only their location.

When I got to the park I confirmed with the ranger that there was a water fountain at the summit. I knew this would be about 11 miles and I figured I had enough water to get me up there. Once at the top, the Visitor Center, my options for getting back opened up. It felt like a safe plan, so I went for it. Halemau’u Trailhead to the Summit, then possibly back from there or a quick trip back to the car via the road that went to the summit, or, I could hitchhike down if I needed it.
We were sad to see the last course, but in a way we were so stuffed, we couldn’t have fit anymore. Unlike Kristien, I have a natural hatred of all things cheesecake, so I had a big decision to make during the whole meal. Would I eat the Marscapone Cheesecake that was served with strawberries and basil? At first I wasn’t sure, but just after the amuse bouche I knew that I trusted Chef Arik to give me something that would blow me away. Let me say, this was an amazing dessert. It was not too sweet and just right in terms of creaminess. The little ribbons of basil, too, added nice bursts of flavor to the cake. Mary paired this course with a great Muscat from Rurtherglen that wasn’t overly sweet.

Each morning when we roll out of bed we are given the world. We can make that day into anything we want just by starting the day right. I must admit, most mornings I hit snooze 10 times, each time dreading more the next time it goes off. The second that alarm goes off I flood my head with negative thoughts; 'ugg its another work day', 'I wonder what fires I will have to put out today', 'I can't wait until today is over', 'why did he break up with me?'. I'll give you one guess how my days turn out! I am a self-fulfilling prophecy. My days are slow, filled with turmoil and work problems, and I am sad and lonely. So today I tried something new! My alarm when off and I smiled. Not because I wanted to but because I needed to. I kissed my dog good morning and she bounced happily out of bed. Down the stairs we went and made some tea and scrubbed the kitchen clean. I drove to work listening to happy music, I greeted everyone with a smile, I sent out 'Good Morning!' texts. I greeted my work crew and checked in with them and I made another cup of tea. Then I opened my reader and found just what I needed to read on Elephant Journal :

It was not a brighter day in Nassau. It rained the entire trip but we were going on the island this time. You can’t let a little rain ruin your vacation. It is all about how you make your experience. We even made fashionable rain outfits out of trash bags! Some of us had on dresses, cardigans, and coats made out of a plastic bag. It was hilarious and we dressed it up with accessories like belts. When we got off the ship we ran to the island, which we didn’t need to do because there were shuttles taking us from the ship to the entrance of the island. We got wet for nothing but we kept pressing on.
Before the Lord ever brought Caleb, my husband, into my life, it was my desire to find ways, as a single girl, that I could be a blessing to a future husband that I didn't know yet. I sought to find ways that I could be a Proverbs 31 wife, bringing her husband good all the days of her life, and during this time, I made a list of some applicable things I could do for my future husband that would act as blessing.

The other thing I love about this is that I don’t have to start out all kinds of wonderful. God seems to be very generous when it comes to handing me seeds to plant. It’s good, because new gardeners and farmers make mistakes in their planting. Planting or sowing isn’t merely a matter of throwing handfuls of seeds onto the ground and hoping for the best. Some seeds must be planted deeper than others. Some need more space while some are good with crowding. Some need more water or more sun or more acid or more alkalinity. The production of a really beautiful, vibrant, fruitful harvest will probably be the end result of lots of mistakes and failures as the new gardener learns and becomes an experienced gardener. The gardener who achieves fruitfulness will be the one who persevered. “Doing good” seems much the same.

I had a meeting yesterday with the team at Simon & Schuster, along with my agent Luigi Bonomi. They detailed the global campaign planned for COVENANT, and it is utterly awesome. I learned a huge amount about how the campaign is designed to produce 'tail-off', maintaining a book's prominent placing on the shelves, along with all sorts of details involving the television adverts, posters, on-line and supermarket promotions. The list was immense, and apparently regarded as one of the biggest and best debut launch campaigns ever seen ( in Australia ).
I created formats for my comics, books, CD’s, DVD’s…even my video games. I’d like to talk about the books.xml file I put together, and how it’s changed across 7 years.
And suddenly, I was a multi-tasker. My MamaEar was attuned to the cry of my kids. And it was good. To everyone but the adult trying to talk to me. But I figured, the adult could deal.

Who needs one more ruckus?

Look closely, though, and the belief in a 2012 apocalypse has a great deal in common with the belief that asset prices can have an infinite upside. Both beliefs offer grand narratives that replace the ordinary patterns of human existence with a something-for-nothing fantasy. The bubble believers insist that they can have limitless wealth without having to work for it; the 2012 believers insist that they can have the new and improved world they think they want—whether that amounts to a new age of enlightenment, on the one hand, or a Hollywood movie world of heroic survivors blazing away against hordes of roving zombies, on the other—without having to work for it. In either case, what drives the fantasy is the conviction that it makes sense to sit on your backside and wait for the market, or the space brothers, or something else to give you the future you think you deserve.

Dundrum Town Centre was opened in 2005 having been built by Anglo “Golden Circle” member Joe O’Reilly and fellow Longford man, the late Liam Maye. The site was reportedly bought for €10.2m. With 79,000 sq metres it claims to be the biggest shopping centre in the State. It is reported to contribute some €7m per annum in local authority rates to DunLaoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The Irish Times claims that the centre had a footfall of 19m, that is 19m visitors, last year and further claims “a great many of them from the affluent south Dublin suburbs”. Phase II of the centre has been given the green light by planning authorities but its future is in doubt against the backdrop of the economic crisis – Phase II was to have been a €600m development which would have seen 101,000 sq metres of space added making the shopping centre the largest in Europe.

In the mean time, I decided to start keeping track of just what words Goldie can say. I started yesterday counting only spoken words, no matter how hard they were to understand. I was blown away that she used 87 different words!! I had no idea she was using that many. Today we weren't as diligent, but I noticed a bunch of words that she didn't say yesterday, so tomorrow we are going to keep track again. I also think its important that most of these were said without prompting. She either initiated the conversation or repeated them after I used them in a sentence. Goldie is not a "performer" so the best way to know where she is developmentally is to watch and interact with her during normal family routines.

The connection between the title & the story only surfaces after you are about 80% into the book, leaving me very non-motivated to even read further to find out what the iron tooth is about in the first place. Even when I did find out what the iron tooth is about, & how it helps the story move further, it’s too late, since the author by then had successfully bored me.

How are you affected by the size of the room you’re in?
Over the past year or so, I've been in a lot of boutiques that are a little new to me. A big reason for that has been location--Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Paris offer some great stores. But I knew what I wanted to look at long before I walked in. In Burberry, I wanted to find THE trench, and I did. How? I walked in, I started looking around, I got approached, and I accepted the offer of help. I told the sales assistant that I was only looking (I said this first off), but I felt it time to think about investing in a trench (given I've been considering this for ten years, my sense of time clearly is fluid). The ensuing discussion and try-ons were about fitting me. That's it. I took the information on the sales assistant's card. When I decide to purchase it, he's who I call. It was all professionally handled--my end, his end. In other words, it wasn't about the cupid's singing--it was about finding information.
In 1950, the remains of Wingate and his nine companions were disinterred from their grave in India. With his family’s agreement, Wingate was taken to what US Military personnel hold to be sacred ground. On the old plantation of confederate General Robert E. Lee, in what is now Arlington National Cemetery, Orde Charles Wingate was laid to rest with full military honors. The fact that this was done at a time when the United States was occupied by the expansion of communism in Asia and a frightening face off with Soviet forces in Europe speaks volumes about how highly the United States Military regarded Orde Wingate.
As a result, it was immensely refreshing for me to read the below article by Aadil Palkhivala, an Ayurvedic practitioner who is widely regarded as one of the world’s top yoga teachers. Things that particularly resonated with me are his simple yet powerful statements like ‘There is no perfect diet, and no ideal food. I encourage you to monitor your food intake to determine what works for you and what doesn’t—diet has to be adjusted individually’. Good common sense in many respects, and principles that are easy to follow and live by. I look forward to reading much more from this wise man!

So God suffers, in other words we suffer, especially our most male component that tries to do good. In other words we believe that any really good men will need to suffer to the point of dying, which in turn will make accompanying good women suffer accordingly, which in turn will make it even harder for people not particularly good at life to catch a break, and since it will be done unto us as we believe, no wonder we can’t seem to stop killing each other incessantly for even two minutes at any given point in time. No wonder we keep ourselves perpetually too lazy to clean up after our own filth, or toss a can in a recycling bin. No wonder those of us who believe that God is greater than the consciousness of a suffering person constantly have to work harder after those who insist on worshipping suffering itself as though it is their own God; as if it is themselves. Since it shall be done unto us as we believe, or at least so says that guy supposedly, can we stop believing in a suffering God now and start believing in a happy one? It seems to be what Jesus would have wanted for us; to believe in a happy God. Or would anyone rather believe in a God that wants us to suffer?

Jim discloses that he was looking at a wall comprised of hundreds upon hundreds of infant bodies, all wrapped in Buddhist ceremonial fabrics, stacked one upon another. Again, Garrow provides no clues with which to test the veracity of this statement, and its purpose seems designed to re-enforce the Western view that the Chinese kill their unwanted daughter's wholesale, against all verifiable evidence to the contrary.

Iran armed their first wave of missiles with EMP warheads designed to unleash a devastating shockwave that destroyed all electronics as soon as they were shot down by the missile defense system.

In other news, yesterday, our friend Amy decided, for her birthday, to conduct a full, costumed, drunken enactment of "Annie," held at a local theater (off hours). I'd say there were about 50 people there plus a bunch of kids. Many were costumed (myself included,) many were drunk on gin and tonics at 10 in the morning (ditto). Sadly, my camera decided to die yesterday morning, so there are no extant photographs of me in my Miss Hannigan outfit. Damn. There was a wig involved, and a red bra, and Mardi Gras beads, and a flask. (Oh, and fair warning to all of you - should you ever find yourself in a situation in which you are expected to perform a largely impromptu 30's period piece musical with many of your friends, DO NOT listen to your significant other if he or she suggests that it would be a good idea to put REAL gin in your prop flask, as that would be "method acting." This, as it turns out, is a BAD IDEA.)

The man at the Auto-Body-Repair Shop said he'd lend me a courtesy car, and so he did. It was quite a nice car in some ways, apart from the rattles, the rust and the black smoke, but it was very small and had a ridiculously low bucket seat, the type that has a 6 inch ledge all round your thighs. With great difficulty I managed to manouevre myself into this ground-level driving seat, with my legs sticking horizontally forward into the well. I drove off, noticing as I did so that the car wouldn't go into second gear, and shortly afterwards, that the petrol gauge registered zero.
This view clearly has much wider significance. That it is at the edges of practically any sphere, from science to society, that diversity and innovation can be found. If you want to know what the next interesting thing will be, look to the edges of society where ideas clash and fuse. Permaculture itself has been pretty marginal for years – as has the eco-movement. Hippies have been quietly living in woods, harvesting water and composting poo for a long time – it is only now that those ideas are gaining weight in the mainstream.
In other words, the use of mantras are not God pleasing. God does not want anyone approaching Him in a senseless manner. He wants us to rightfully use the mind He created for us. To approach the most holy LORD of all, without using the gift of our full senses is an abomination and a gross sign of disrespect. It’s being silly — and we are not to act silly before God Almighty. That is sinful.

Whatever sleepiness that had settled in during my uneventful evening was now flushed away with a sea of adrenaline.

The housing payout shock comes after the hook-handed cleric won the right to keep his British ­citizenship. That victory raised fears he will be successful in his fight to avoid extradition to the US to face terror ­charges.
Well… It all started when I had a summer class with a group of High School girls. They kept talking about these dramas… How cute the men were .. How pretty the girls were… how they cried and laughed and just fell in love with every character. I thought awww… isn’t that cute. Their little obsession ..aww to be a teenager again. I figured I needed to stay hip and on top of the latest fads.. being a teacher… so I had better watch one so I can identify with my teenage girl students….Then OMG…I was hooked. Oh… they are like .. extended versions of our afterschool specials but with a little more humor and action.

Note that we plotted WKU first, followed by other member Sun Belt institutions. After that, the remaining Kentucky schools went on. Beyond that, I left it up to my son to ask questions and pick states until the session ended.

7. Some people will argue that Columbus Day is a day for recognition of Italians, an Italian Pride Day. Are Italians more worthy of recognitionthan other ethnic groups in this country we have proudly (?) nicknamed"The Melting Pot"? I have heard Italians say that Germans have Oktoberfest, the Irish have St. Patrick's Day and Mexicans have Cinco deMayo, but none of those are FEDERAL holidays. The only two ethnic groups worthy of recognition for their contributions and sacrifice in this land are those who were ALREADY HERE when the Europeans came and those who the Europeans BROUGHT HERE IN CHAINS. All other ethnic groups came here voluntarily. It was long overdue but African Americans finally got their holiday - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in January.... but Native Americans still don't have a holiday (urge your congressmen and women to support House Bill #167).

Audi’s Q3 is an interesting proposition. It’s aimed squarely at the BMW X1 and offers decent performance from a range of small petrol and diesel engines. Combining sporty premium SUV features in a compact body, the Q3 range starts at R370,000. It looks a little ordinary but its strength will be in ride, road holding and luxury interior. In a move that is most unlike Audi, there are some really funky colours available for the Q3. Google “Samoa Orange” if you don’t believe me.
I also purchased various dried herbs- these are often served on a Greek salad and mixes for making authentic tzatziki. And of course some real Feta cheese. Rich and creamy, salty, moist and slightly sour, semi-solid and certainly not hard and tasteless like you often find here.
As if these were not enough of a reason for both to remember the fixture, Alan Ball broke his leg by, in his own words, sitting on it.

Handwriting: Part of the writing process is the ability to put words on paper. I know. Seems kinda obvious, right? But I've known a lot of parents (*points to self*) who expect their kids to journal and create and express their loving hearts out on paper before this skill has taken root. For some kids, the fine motor control just isn't there until age eight or so. Until then, don't feel like you're "cheating" if your child is verbalizing answers and sentences while you write them down.

Meanwhile, Greene was acting her heart out, doing the best she could with the character of a burned-out, child-like brown-acid-victim, who hysterically confesses to crimes she hasn’t committed in order to pad out the plot… but her refusal to burst into song, or call upon the “Pie Hole” gang to help solve the case definitely counts against her here. It was kinda cool to see her dressed as a hippie-ish “rock chick” though… more of that, please! Martin just seemed to be irritated by everyone and everything she encountered… presumably because she knows she’s the heroine of a murder mystery story, who can’t actually solve murder mysteries. That must be quite frustrating for her. Siemaszko was mostly there to react to exposition, but she managed to keep things fairly lively, so a tip of the hat to her for that… and I enjoyed Tina Lifford’s turn as ‘Bonnie’, the kindly owner of the B&B where the main characters take their regular coffee breaks. Other than that, everything was pretty yawn-worthy…

Although there is beautiful scenery, “Treasure Island” takes an unflinching look at the hardships of the seafaring life and features genuine tension. After the camp silliness of “Pirates of the Caribbean,” the authenticity is refreshing. As for all the stabbing and the like, well, as Long John Silver says, without violence or the threat of it, “other men take what’s yours and they live the life that should be yours.”

I slammed on my brakes and surveyed the scene. I could hardly breathe and was momentarily overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of those few seconds. As a neighbor and Mr. Dorsey rushed to Michael’s aid I turned around and rode as fast as I could to his house, back up the hill on Rittenhouse and a right turn onto 48th Avenue. A block later as I turned left, onto our street, I passed Michael’s five-year old sister Sandy at the corner and shouted to her as I passed, “Michael’s been hit by a car!” Climbing the stairs to their front porch I pounded on the open screen door and shouted inside repeating to his parents what I had just told Sandy moments before. His dad rushed out the door and leaped from their porch yelling frantically “Where? Where?” I said “Down the hill on Rittenhouse Street!” I struggled on my bike to keep up with Michael’s father as he ran like a racehorse to his son’s side. Michael’s mother arrived soon behind as I watched from a short distance away.

We lost touch after that as we were living very different lives. One day as I was bravely pushing a double pram up a hill in my local shopping centre, his mother walked by. She stopped to chat and I proudly showed off my two babies. I asked how my ex was doing and she told me that he was about to be married for the second time, and that he had recovered from ‘his breakdown’. Immediately I remembered the shaking hands and the lost look in his eye. So the past had caught up with him after all.

I still have to take care of changing my name on my mortgage, as that's a bit of a hassle. But I'm going to get that done really soon now, as I believe I've found the documents I need to do this. I'm just about done with seeing that old name on any mail....

The first time I saw the end of Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Eclisse I felt I had been caught off guard, disoriented. The film ends with a string of desolate shots without any narrative progression, shown one after another. For most of the film we had been following the drama of the central characters. Suddenly, for the last seven minutes, the characters we have come to know have disappeared — and yet the film continues. We see deserted streets, shadows, anonymous strangers. Without the characters to ground us in story, the presence of the camera itself seems stronger. We become aware of it as an apparatus, a seeing-device that acts as its own separate entity. There is camera movement (panning, following a figure walking on a street) which suggests that something is about to be revealed; it seems Antonioni is trying to tell us something. There are some wide, long takes from above that slowly pan around as if surveying the streets. Trees rustle in the wind. A man in a suit rounds a corner. A toddler looks up at his mother. A close up of a man’s earlobe. A stream of water flows into the gutter. “Yes, what is it Antonioni?” I remember thinking, “What are you trying to show us?” I was searching for meaning, for story. A streetlamp burns brightly. The music crescendos. The film is over. There is an elegance to this sequence that I cannot quite explain.

So after all this time, I'm still here at a day shy of 38 weeks. Baby has moved head down and into birth position (though is not well engaged in the pelvis yet), and is healthy as can be or so say the tests. The last growth scan indicated a 7+ pound infant and my new doctor cheerfully informed me that if I go to 40 weeks, we may have a 9-pounder on our hands. I did not find that amusing.
Use any size cutter you want, but make sure to pack them in your pan tightly and let them rise a long time, until they are doubled.

Howeverm the dough can be made a head and refrigerated for up to a week for even better flavor.

They've never really done one before and I have to say, this one was quite a doozy! Our backyard is right at the tee box of a golf course, so they sat in our yard and caught all the golfers passing. At 25 cents a cup (and they sold some cookies for 50 cents each) $15 total is not a bad profit! They were stoked. And wanted to do it again the next day. I told them they couldn't or the city might shut them down for making too much money. :)
He could also see Tanner, his German Shepard, still asleep on his pillow over next the couch, probably because the damn dog was as drunk as he was from drinking beer last night. The dog had the strange habit of watching tourists and when one would leave the table he or she was sitting at, quickly run up, knock the bottle to the floor, and begin lapping of the spilled liquid. It was a trick Jack and other locals enjoyed since Tanner had the uncanny ability to target the most obnoxious person of whatever tourist group happened to be visiting at that time, usually a white, middle-aged American male.

I suspect the days in June were very rare for me indeed, as they seem to pass as if in slow motion. Too hot weather, too early at times, and then the perfect summer days that one wants never to end. And then there is the intensity of July! Is there enough iced-tea? Are the white shirts cool enough? Are the plants on the terrace getting enough water? July seems to ask a lot of us. Even getting to vacation locations has its imperatives.

With a career total of more than 100 films, Bette changed the way Hollywood looked at actresses. In 1977, she was the first woman to be honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also the first woman to be president of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. At the age of 75, Bette had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. Nine days later, she suffered a stroke. Despite her failing health, she continued to act until her death. Bette passed away October 6, 1989 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.

The epidemic of the disease, has been fueled by the collapse of Zimbabwe’s water, sanitation and health systems. Many hospitals have shut down and most towns suffer from poor water supply, broken sewers and uncollected waste. With the upcoming rainy season even more infections could occur as water sources become contaminated.

Well, it's empty and filled with remnants of fall leaves, making the ground slippery and forcing anyone to look at their feet rather than at the sky.

Make Real Estate Work for the City – especially in the cases of cities like Baltimore and Detroit which have declined from larger populations, there is a huge untapped potential in the vacant housing and real estate for economic development. First, rehabilitation of vacant housing and real estate can be the foundation for a direct job creation program with extremely valuable production. Second, selling that housing cheaply (in the case of Baltimore for a dollar) or just giving it away to working people literally spreads the wealth while expanding the city’s tax base. As occupancy rates in these properties rise, so does the value of housing and land the city owns – building up the Metropolitan Reserve Banks in turn. Third, it can provide a real solution for homelessness by just giving people a key to an apartment and access to facilities.

He completely re-did the smaller one this past weekend because it had an algae problem. He put new substrate in the bottom, bought new plants, washed out the tank completely, and even gave the fish some new decorations. He’s also ordered a new bulb to help with the plants and algae. We’re hoping the new additions/upgrades keep the algae in check because the tank is looking great at the moment.

Families often ask me how i can get their child to do something they can't.. well i have limited emotional investment ( not MY child) and i listen and observe the behavior so i understand the communication. If you react rather than respond you are liable to misunderstand and the behavior continues. We need to be the problem solvers we want our children to grow up to be. They need to test the rules, we need to set them. It is our job as parents to be completely present all the time, ( which is not always doable). It is necessary to be all Parent and only some person when the children are under 5. I tell parents that there is a big P and a little t in parent... we must embrace that big P in order for the adult child to walk away from us at 18 or 20 and be independent and ultimately successful.

He tells of life before and after the Genocide; he includes the various factions and entities present, from the UN peacekeeping force to the Rwandan Patriotic Front to the Interahamwe. The brevity helps; too many words would drown this story. The simplicity emphasizes the horror.

Hyun Suk confronts M2 with the video. They all wonder how it got there and Hyun Suk asks if they’re the ones in the video. Jae Ha is about to stand but Seung Yeon stops him. Team Leader Han takes them to task and Hyun Sung speaks up-it was them. Chang Min tells him to be specific-as in who was and who wasn’t there. Hyun Suk is shrewd and asks Chang Min what he wants to say but Jae Ha speaks up, wanting to take responsibility. Chang Min scoffs at him and Hyun Suk sees it. The team sits outside later-minus Jae Ha wondering who took the video and Tae Gun rightly points out-anyone could’ve taken the movie but not everyone could have delivered it to Hyun Suk with a look at Chang Min. Chang Min owns up to it. They wonder how he could betray the team and if he had that little confidence in himself. Chang Min scoffs, at least he’s not lying like someone else, with a look at Seung Yeon! In Hyun Suk’s office, Hyun Suk asks to hear the reason Jae Ha went on stage without the company’s permission. Did he go to earn money or he wanted to show the world his talent? Jae Ha tells them he needed the money so he took the gig and everyone just helped him. Hyun Suk asks, is it for the same reason you go out with your guitar every night? Team Leader Han is stunned. Jae Ha has a part time gig and Hyun Suk knew it? At Jae Ha’s response, Hyun Suk smiles and tells him it’s good he’s honest and confident. Meanwhile, Woo Hyun is on his way back to the company from the airport. Everyone’s still pissed at Jae Ha who comes back and tells them it’ll be fine, he’ll take the blame. Seung Yeon tells Chang Min he shouldn’t have betrayed the team like this and he rounds back at her, however anyone else says things, she has no right to condemn him. He asks her if she thinks she has the right to be on the team and turns to Ji Woo too who tries to defend Seung Yeon. Before a fight breaks out, Team Leader Han walks in.

The way out of impossibilities is to fully realize that it is an illusion, perpetuated by our own attachment to an erroneous perception of reality. When we notice we are feeling mired and stuck, we can challenge the impossibilities by asking our self: “Is it true that I am not loved?” When we are open, ready and willing to release attachments to the impossibilities, the answer becomes: “No! The very essence of life itself is love. And I am of life. I am of Nature. I too am the stuff that is Nature. I am connected to everything, everywhere, always. I am love!”

At some point in the future I may post about self-publishing, but it’s too late for me to get into that tonight. It is something I want to talk about, as I had a conversation about it today, and I’ve had a lot of really interesting conversations about it in the past. And especially because I don’t really know what I think of it.
Parents were invited again, and I put in a brief appearance with Possum. We didn't stay long because Mousie seemed to think she had to sit with us, but we could see she wanted to join in with the dancing that was going on over at the other side of the room. I knew we made the right decision when we looked back through the window and saw her happily doing the conga with her friends.
Today in German-speaking Europe many families set up an Advent wreath, or Adventskranz on the first Advent Sunday (the fourth before Christmas) to start off the Advent season. The picture on the left shows a typical evergreen Advent wreath with its four candles, one for each week of Advent. Traditional families gather around the wreath on each Advent Sunday to light the next candle and sing Christmas carols. This was even more important in the past, when the Christmas tree was usually reserved for a special unveiling only on Christmas Eve. Until then, the Advent wreath provided the evergreen look and aroma in the house.

We crossed the Stari Most to Coppersmiths’ Street (Kujundziluk). Lined with vendors selling souvenirs made by local artists and coppersmiths, many items portrayed the Old Bridge. We visited several of the little shops. One of the coppersmiths we spoke with asked where we were from and then proudly told us he had a daughter who lives in the United States.We bought a few souvenirs for ourselves and family (later, we would see all the same kinds of souvenirs in Istanbul (read about the trip here).

After having a rough arrival to Melbourne, with housing drama, I was very excited to take a few days from the apartment search and relax in true Aussie fashion on the beach. I made my trek to the university a whopping 9 kilometer walk to campus (just another incentive to find a new place to live). I made some fast friends waiting for the trip leaders to organize the buses and we set off for an adventure on the Great Ocean Road.
I know I haven't been around much. Preoccupied. You see, in just two weeks from today I'll be driving back to the place I spent four of the best years of my life. Oddly enough, I haven't been back since.

With the cooling weather I've sought to make some comfort food - a simple borlotti bean ragu. At its heart is a soffritto - onion, celery, carrot - to which I've added red capsicum and grated zucchini. Red capsicum when slowly cooked adds a lovely sweetness to the dish and grated zucchini thickens the sauce and makes it almost creamy.

Like communism or socialism, capitalism is a word with objective, specific meaning. The French word “laissez-faire” literally means “let us alone.” According to Ayn Rand, the greatest contemporary philosopher who offered the best defense of this most moral economic system, capitalism simply means “a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.” Sison is right in saying that capitalism is about greed and self-interest. This is because the moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist claim that it represents the best way to achieve the common good. Under a true capitalist system, the achievement of common good is merely a secondary consequence.

We used to say that we would struggle, fight, and wage Jihad, until we regain our rights, because what was taken by force will only be restored by force, and what was taken by the sword will not be restored by the pen or the word. Unfortunately, however, we have abandoned this, and we have taken the path of the so-called “peaceful solution.” We have made one concession after another.

What made me so sorrowful? It was pointed out to me that my heart is not perfect and the truth of it makes me mourn. It’s what I want MORE THAN ANYTHING and it cuts cruel and deep, “Father, please cover my imperfect heart with your breastplate of righteousness”.

On the way home from our favourite farm on Tuesday we stopped off for a wander around a small town. In a shop window were a row of Queenie's, all slowly waving with glazed expressions. Being suckers for plastic stuff that does nothing more than make us laugh meant we needed one so we rushed in to bag our own Queenie. Now she sits on our windowsill watching and waving while we do kitchen stuff. Our favourite plastic friend was a chubby grinning chinese boy who sat astride a pink dolphin and spun from the ceiling playing plinky music. He fell to pieces a long while back now and I still miss him.

Of course, if they were forced to read "Guns, Germs, and Steel," there would be a hell of a lot more suicide bombers than there are now. Jeez, that book did go on. I thought a better name for it would have been "Location, Location, Location: and what they ate while they were there," but I guess that title is not as catchy. There were not enough guns or germs, and steel barely got a mention. What did get mentioned, repeatedly, was the phrase "food production," approximately 1,296,379 times. McDonald's does not talk about food production that much, for Christ's sake. Then again, McDonald's doesn't serve food, so maybe that's why.

27. Evangelista - In Animal Tongue
Homosexuals have chosen the word “gay,” a word that means “happy” or “a lively, merry mood” or “bright, showy,” to describe their lifestyle. In homosexuality’s portrayal in the media and in its publicity by its advocates, that’s what it can appear to be. A fun-loving, free lifestyle. Yet this is only a mirage. Over the years, in every interaction I have had with a person calling their lifestyle “gay,” that same angry fire that my bookstore acquaintance had could be seen in their eyes . Whether it’s been a one-time opportunity to interact with someone who has identified himself as gay or the longer-term weekly counseling of a man who claimed hundreds of partners (and looked as if it were true), a below-the-surface, seething anger has always been present.

Once I was here I needed to taka a taxi to the confernce center. I had google mapped it, and it was about a 5 minute drive. So I gave the address to the driver, who seemed to know wehre it was but then proceeded to get lost and drive around for about 30 minutes looking for it. It turned into a very expensive taxi ride. I paid it, but I wish now I'd been a bit more assertive about saying that I shouldn't have been charged so much.
Once Isaac is released from the gurney he's been strapped to, he's forced to flee the ward as Necromorphs jump out from around corners and burst through ducts. Cue the frantic escape sequence. But here's the fun part: he's still tied up in a straight jacket. A prompt instructs us to hold down the left shoulder button to run. The straight jacket conceit makes this particular piece of scaffolding feel natural while also playing on that horror movie trope, the powerless protagonist.
So...the next time you look at those wonderful fall leaves or pick up a bright red maple leaf or wonder at the beauty of a yellow hickory leaf - remember how those wonderful colors were produced - and realize how magical a plant really is to the planet. Not because of the colors of the leaves or how it looks in our landscape, but how it keeps us alive by producing all of that sugar and oxygen that keeps us eating and breathing every day.
Wait wait wait... what does Star Wars have to do with any of this? Apparently, no movie like Meteor is going to admit wanting to jump on the same bandwagon as George Lucas and company, but it would be idiotic of it not to think that any geek high off of the adventures of a galaxy far far away wouldn't want to keep the intergalactic ball rolling by signing up for an adventure that involves NASA, rockets, desperate scientists and the fate of mankind. Maybe Neame and his crew thought that Meteor was the anti-Star Wars; science fiction for the thinking set.
The less you can explain the questions of your purpose and existence the more you come up with a ridiculous analysis for life and your left with no reason for existing or for life at all. The cycle continues. The more hateful against anything good and morally right you get. The more you hate those stupid Christians that claim God exists and that say there is a reason and purpose for your life .
During most races we see the mechanics make adjustments to the car during pitstops. During each stint radio communications between the driver and his race engineer will discuss the cars balance. Whether the car tends to oversteer or understeer. Since the ban on active technologies there’s little the teams can do to alter the car during the race. Currently only front wing adjustment, rear wing gurney removal and tyre pressures are easily changed during the hectic 3-4s pitstops.

What I wanted at TBEX was a session that presented the reality of writing as a profession, not as a quixotic pursuit or a weekend hobby or gap year boondoggle. Admittedly, I wanted this for myself as much as anything. Because I struggle with what I do (what is that, anyways?) all the time. I wanted to hear people who I think of as grown up, professional travel writers speak honestly about how they juggle all this stuff, how they manage to make it work. I’m always grateful for time with writers who will share, honestly, how they get by — a recent conversation revealed a writer’s need to sell multiple stories about one destination with every trip in order to make the travel pay off. “I can’t go just because I want to. I need to sell that story five times over to have it be worth my while.”
Both babies measured great - he's 1lb, 2oz and she's 15.9oz, which puts them right about at the 50th percentile. They had good fluid levels, solid heartbeats, and my bleed has officially absorbed!!

In the United Kingdom after days of obfuscation and half-denials the Prime Minister admits he did ride a horse loaned to a tabloid news editor he was friendly with by the police force that was investigating her newspaper.
I wanted to go with a vintage theme for Mum. Not saying she is old though! Just wanted something a bit nostalgic. It also took me out of my own comfort zone, as I don't normally do vintage! I loved using the Hat Pin (retired), and I have also used the Velvet Ribbon available in the new Summer Mini Catalogue. I didn't want cream though and dyed this ribbon, using my Night of Navy ink pad. I was surprised how beautifully this ribbon dyed up! Not at all patchy as I thought it would.
I know from my own experience that my horse (who currently schools Fourth Level and some of the Prix St. George) cannot school in the arena more than three days per week. (And he’ll tell you if you ask!) So to keep him fresh, interested, and fit, we spend the three days hacking out, doing trot and canter sets in the lanes, or long-lining, another three days doing a more traditional schooling routine, and then he gets one day off per week. And I generally find that I get my best, show-quality work from him on the day after he’s either rested or hacked – particularly if we struggled with a problem or issue in our last training session prior to the rest day. It’s like the time away has shown him what he needs to do to get it right (and me too!), so with a little bit of cogitation and fresh muscles, it’s all right there.
Article 8 does not always work though. A paedophile illegal immigrant, Zulfar Hussain, has finally been thrown out of Britain after a long court battle in which he claimed that his deportation would breach his human rights. This is good news, but Hussain represents only a drop in the multicultural ocean and cost the taxpayer over £100,000 in his welfare funded legal battle to remain in Blackburn, Lancashire.
So our unique perceptions of the world we experienced together were destined to be endlessly different, destined to be unrelated. And no matter what I said to her, she would never understand that what I write on these pages, when I say that I have no home and that I am endlessly tormented by the constant need to leave everything behind and travel, to give up the entire world I’ve created and move on to something new, that this isn’t in any way a sad thing in my eyes.

Here comes another rant from me, THE CHILDLESS MOMMY BLOGGER, as I’ve taken to calling myself. You know, I think (much like Oprah – another childless mommy advisor) that the hardest thing you can do is raise a kid. And even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more a**hole. This is of such monumental importance in my opinion, that it does, indeed, take a village. So, I’m here to help. As I was working up some research this morning, I came across some parenting ideas / actions/ products that I feel could lead your child astray. I am here to try and stop you…or rather stop the ridiculous human being who would subject their child to any of the below.

Straight away, one has to think about Mycoplasma pneumonia. People at highest risk for mycoplasma pneumonia include those living or working in crowded areas such as schools, Army barracks and homeless shelters. The incubation time for Mycoplasma pneumonia is one to 4 weeks. This means that it takes one to 4 weeks after catching the bug to become ill. A bit like with chickenpox, which has an incubation time of one to 3 weeks.

Lancôme had offered the lower court an expert report of a physical-chemical analysis of the two perfumes. The report concluded that, given the fact that there are hundreds of different components that could have been used, it is highly unlikely that it is a coincidence that Kecofa used 24 of the exact components out of the 26 in total used by Lancôme. The 25th ingredient was a cheaper substitute of the remaining Trésor component. Since the expertise of the report was not denied by Kecofa, nor the accusation of copying, the Court concluded that Kecofa must have copied Lancôme’s product and therefore violated Lancôme’s copyrights.

My cough has become a part of who I am. My roommates know when I get home because they hear me coughing when I walk through the door. It tells them.... "HONEY I'M HOME!" My friends hear me coming wherever I go (though its tough to sneak up on them in that respect). To me, some days, my cough isn't something gross and disgusting, its just something I do every day. It's as natural as breathing.

Caracole is a new company, but like so many in Belgium, the residents inhabit an ancient brewery. Located in Wallonia, near the French border in Falmignoul, Brasserie Moussoux was founded ten years before America was born. In the year the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the name was changed to Brasserie Lamotte before eventually becoming Caracole in the year Clinton was first elected. The brewery is proud of its artisinal heritage, and still brews the old-fashioned way, over a wood fire.

And the knowledge that 24 weeks isn't a magical marker at which all problems vanish is there. I cling to that date, but I am aware of the real statistics. I know the outcomes, and I know that babies still die, that there are still very real and present risks, and longterm complications, and so I am not content with that date either. But at the least, that gives us a chance.
So, slowly, slowly, I learnt that the best treatment for me was simplicity. No more, no less. Good, healthy food, cooked from scratch. No toxic chemicals, no pointless additives, not even thickeners if a reduction will do. No neon drinks or fizzy pop. No synthetic creams or juice "drinks". Add in a dose of sunshine and I feel zingy and alive. Sunshine, fresh air and simple, freshly cooked food.
Examples of physics abound in the natural world. Many animals and plants utilize the natural laws of our universe to live, reproduce, and obtain food. It has been known for many years that bats use high frequency sound waves to echo-locate insects on nightly forays in search of food. What has recently been discovered is a plant that actively encourages bats to drink nectar from it's fruit, and spread pollen in the process by forming echo-genic leaves designed to allow bats an easier time in finding the fruiting portions of the plant. Isn't life marvelous?
Whereas the angels depicted by Giotto and earlier painters had their wings fixed in place because paint can’t move, Guy made the conscious choice (albeit, the easier one) to keep that immobility while allowing the angels themselves to fidget and wander.

Darren Richmond! Well, HE certainly pulled himself together in a hurry, didn’t he? He even made a joke when Jamie was tying up his shoes, and again later to Gwen. I was happy to see Gwen back, actually. It’ll be interesting to see if she and Richmond and Jamie can all just work together, but so far it looks to be going okay. Richmond handled himself perfectly in the interview with the nosey lady, and it looks like Gwen at least feels she can help him win. Actually, I think maybe all three of them think she could be the one to put them over the top – if anyone can.
Not all fear is bad. In fact, fear can be very good & right. The whole subculture centered around 'No Fear' I find to be idiotic actually. Some things should be feared. Crazy man has a gun: let's go walk up to him and call him a wus because we have no fear? That's not just lack of fear that's lack of intelligence. You'll soon be dead: evolution at work if you haven't bred yet. So fear isn't universally bad. It is a survival instinct, and an important one.
The chronic behaviour pattern has to be procrastination. There are some things that continue to escape my best intentions. If there ever was a miscast accountant, it’s me.

I think as a parent of a child with a disability there is sometimes the tiniest little check, a hesitation when I think about the future. It’s not the gasping for air, punch to the gut it used to be, but sometimes there’s a little catch in the throat as I wonder “Is it realistic?” This is often accompanied by some momma guilt (Do I have the right to wonder what’s realistic?) and some self-doubt (Do I not believe enough in my child?).

Happy New Year everyone. Such a cliche yet.... 2012 sounds good to me. Ever the cockeyed optimist, I've scanned the headlines this morning, the world is in a mess, killing over religion, tribal warfare continues unabated, and yet I still have a deep seated notion that this year may bring some respite from the economic trials of the last several years.
But I’m waiting to actually finish something (and get some fun ‘after’ pics), so those projects will have to wait.
I honor those of you who took the time to post comments on Facebook, after reading my post… your efforts helped me to gain additional perspective… and your words will remain as an inspiration to all those who read them… I am forever grateful for your expressions of love and support…. I really do have the most amazing friends!
So what now for Austria. The ability to tip the scales of power lies in the hand of the Nationalist Parties and given that the "established" traitor parties have said they will not enter into another coalition, anything is now possible.
“I don’t mean the penny. Don’t you feel as if someone’s looking after us?”
It all begins by loving God. It starts with loving God. If we love God, and if we are born of God we will love God, then we cannot help but love those who are also born of him. It is simply incompatible with our heritage and parentage to not love those who belong to the family of God. There should be no civil war in the family of God. But sometimes it seems that the family of God is so fractured that it is perpetually defeated. It makes one wonder how often the enemy capitalizes on this? It makes one wonder what those literally not born of God think about those who claim to be born of God. What sort of family do they believe us to be? What sort of fractured family are we?
Why did I choose HS'ing? I found myself giving my best to other peoples children and having a short fuse with mine. I didn't like it at all...one bit. I wanted to give my best to my children. They deserved it and still do. I knew that if I could spend the majority of my day educating other people's children and loving it (which I did), that I would love it that much more to be able to give that to my babies. I do! I love teaching them. I love it when they teach me, because they do.
By 1953, he began to make collages, which soon became the precursors of pop art, incorporating cigarette logos, images from fan magazines. He coined a phrase for them - "moticos" - and carried them around New York, showing them to strangers in public places and asking for their reactions and recording them (most of this work has been destroyed or recycled).

Being a quilter, I can't resist the allure of vintage wooden bobbins and spools, and one dealer had a terrific assortment of vintage beehive bobbins—just 50 cents a piece! The larger bobbin pictured was only a $1. I have seen these go for as much as $10 a piece but I suspect their actual value is somewhere in between.

Their relationship was not only funny, especially when John would get over-protective and jealous even with his best friend Will, it was adorable and passionate. One of those passionate parts I loved was when John found Meg in a car with Eric, her non-boyfriend boyfriend, and his reaction, a mix of hurt and anger, had me swooning.

The weather forecast threatens more rain tomorrow, which I hope will subside before the afternoon, as I plan to visit Jardin Japonese and Jardin Zoologico. Wouldn't be much fun in the freezing rain or wind. And in any case, I will be more prepared for the weather tomorrow! First thing I will buy in the morning will be a thermos and a set of Yerba Mate. I think I've grown addicted to the bitter stuff, and I can't wait to have my own thermos to carry around like those old men of Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile.

WSU's plans quickly became a hot topic on local online sites. Though most people applauded plans for the new biomedical center, many deplored the potential loss of the building.
The Alaimo Group of Mount Holly was up for a contract last fall to evaluate and suggest improvements to Trenton Water Works. But campaign finance records released this week show the two employees donated a total of $4,500 to the political action committee (PAC) Partners for Progress in early June. Partners for Progress reported it gave more than $10,000 in both direct and in-kind contributions to Mayor Tony Mack in the two weeks leading up to his victory in the mayoral runoff election June 15.
And when it's often difficult to predict a law's impact, legislators should think twice before carrying any bill. Is it absolutely necessary? Is it an issue serious enough to merit their attention? Will it definitely not make the situation worse?

Here is why Wandry matters. Our current system imposes a gift tax of up to 35% when taxpayers give assets away, with exceptions. Individuals now get one $5.12 million lifetime exemption, and they can also give up to $13,000 of assets a year to an unlimited number of recipients. (Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.

Though Maryland is the wealthiest state in the country, all Maryland's children are not equal. Maryland is not exempt from the conditions that allowed the Trayvon Martin tragedy to occur. Our battle for equity for all of our children is not just against individuals, it is against established systems and institutions. Child-wellbeing indicators show disparities from infancy to adulthood. See Advocates for Children and Youth at http://www.acy.org for more information. There are health disparities in infant mortality and low-birthweight babies. There are educational disparities in academic achievement and disparate administering of school discipline policies such as suspensions, expulsions, and school-based arrests. There are child welfare system disparities that show children of color being removed from home at higher rates than their white counterparts. There are juvenile justice system disparities at every stage from arrest to placement to youth being tried as adults.

The new law, which takes effect immediately, requires bareheaded riders 21 and older to carry at least $20,000 in additional medical insurance. Riders also must have passed a motorcycle safety course or have had their motorcycle endorsement for at least two years.

"We don't think $458 million is representative of the cost of this project," said Obletz. "We think that number represented a series of the most expensive sub-options.

The U.S.-led coalition routinely reports each time an American or other foreign soldier is killed by an Afghan in uniform, but the military is under-reporting the number of overall attacks. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, does not report attacks in which the Afghan wounds ? or misses ? his U.S. or allied target. It also doesn't report the wounding of troops who were attacked alongside those who were killed.
That means advancing past the first round, then pushing Miami or Chicago, the likely second-round opponent, to at least six games, if not pulling off the upset.

People close to the Edwardses, speaking privately, say they have been torn about whom to support.

Then comes the defense, which has played outstanding all season and deserves much credit for those gaudy goalie stats. And not only do they protect the net, they produce. Kevin Shattenkirk's 23 points ranks 18th in the league among defensemen and Alex Pietrangelo comes in right behind him with 21 points, good enough for 26th among defensemen. And with Shatty (plus-17), Petro (+14) and Barret Jackman (+13), the Blues have three defensemen who rank in the top

Questionable Calls: Wilson was a major reach at the 48th overall selection as a safety with suspect range who wasn't much of a ball-hawk at Illinois.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like.

Eurama cautions her against prizing the fabric over the person, a lesson that doesn't quite land, even when McKinley is swept into mourning at an indigo-tinged funeral when Eurama's husband dies. After this, McKinley continues to collect in weighty encounters successive fabrics, traveling along roads and through outposts that she notes were built for imperial extraction. McKinley's description of indigo's history, which often arises as overly deliberate exposition, is best when it appears like this, as it is — underfoot, in the air. Her most difficult procurement comes in the middle of an attempted coup in the Ivory Coast, where she sees herself mirrored in an upper-class African woman carrying, amid chaos over control of wealth, a Chanel purse: "I'm just like her; I'm unable to give up the ghost of the things I hope will fill me with meaning."

They might never -- literally never -- show the budget reaching balance. Not in the 10-year window and not if they take their graphs out 100 years. Obama could probably show balance just past the budget window in the middle of the next decade because of the massive Medicare cuts he proposes, even if in practice they will never actually happen."

In your case, online statements have made it easier to access information at your convenience, which is a good thing.

The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."

Strangely, the shift in the tight game came courtesy of two huge three-pointers by Holiday in the fourth quarter. With the Sixers leading, 74-73, and Holiday having made only six of 21 shots, the third-year guard rose from 27 feet with the confidence he always seems to have.

When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate.

Everybody has their own style on how they play, and if they get ready or not. We just have to come out with more fire, especially in day games.

When you get something taken away from you, you really miss it and it kind of re-instilled how much I really do love it.

We get a newsletter every few months from the California Board of Accountancy that divulges all the accountants in California who are in trouble. It's very serious - monkey business is not allowed.

When you look at the internal data on international tests you find a telling dichotomy regarding American scores. America has a disproportional number of students doing very, very well and a large portion doing poorly.

Twenty-two percent of American children live in mind-numbing poverty, which is far greater than the next highest country. Children do not learn well when they are hungry.

As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall.

Federal law often uses interstate transportation of weapons and other instruments of crime to establish jurisdiction in violent crime matters. Last year, responding to a plea from state and local leaders to suppress gun violence, this district prosecuted 218 of the worst violent criminals in federal court. In most cases, we used a law that prohibits convicted felons from possessing a gun that traveled at some point in interstate commerce. We also prosecuted the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history under a law that relied partially on the federal Section 8 housing program. Rightfully, the community expected us to use these federal tools to help in those cases.

Albergo has cooked at several New Jersey restaurants, including Osteria Dante in Red Bank and Church Street in Montclair. Rather than learning his art in culinary school, he was, in effect, home-schooled.

If you use charcoal, you can arrange the coals in a few different ways. Light your coals as usual.

The latter is the best bet for smaller grills, as it gives you the maximum cooking area.

I’ve been fortunate to cover a few hospital stories over the past year with the Chicago Tribune. While it may sound like an emotionally wrenching assignment, I use the word "fortunate" because I feel that it’s an honor telling the stories of patients going through such hardships.

Linda Wilson: You are right that the left of the two left turn lanes is a continuous flow for traffic to eastbound Manchester. Really the only people that should be stopping in the right left turn lane are those want to cross over to go to West County Mall.

The Four Seasons is a timeless old-style Hawaiian resort — tiki torches, orchid leis and all — which is fine with me. "We absolutely celebrate that fact," Whitfield said.

(The Douglas County prosecutor, I hasten to add, promptly filed perjury charges against Chartraw in 2007 after she testified in the Lawson case. "A vindictive prosecution," Fahy said. Presiding Judge Joan Seitz apparently agreed: "Not even close," she said after finding Chartraw not guilty.)
But the easiest tanking decision comes when there is a great player available at No. 1, and potential franchise players behind him, too.
This is not to say that you shouldn't use any passive treatments. While learning how to perform your exercise therapy program, it's important to do whatever you need to do to control symptoms, whether it's massage, chiropractic and/or medication.

Though just a one-sport standout, the Chaminade senior shined brighter and stood shoulders above the awe-inspiring amount of talented prep athletes in West County. This honor pales in comparison to the honors the polite 17-year-old from Vinita Park has pulled in, but Beal is also the West County Journal Male Athlete of the Year.
Since scoring 15 points against Howard in week five, Oakland Mills has scored less points each week since (7, 6, 0). If the Scorpions can score two touchdowns against a Hammond defense that has allowed 73 points in the last two weeks, it would be a small victory at the end of a long season.

In another part of the Bumthang region, a gentle walk through fields led us to the Temple of the Divine Madman, renowned for helping fertility.

Years of experience have taught me that real reconciliation cannot occur without two essential ingredients: trust and truth.

I?m not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been, and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why?

Another popular house specialty is wiener schnitzel ($9.75). John buys meat from Amish farms and cuts the thin slices of veal for the schnitzel.

Then there’s Wright, the Mets’ last remaining icon. Last week, former Mets skipper Davey Johnson, now leading the Nationals, publicly wondered why the Mets would not extend Wright, who has a $16 million team option (against a $1 million buyout) for next year.
Apollo Kids. I like it better than Fishscale; I think it's his best album since Supreme Clientele. But you didn't hear anything about it, because the musical calendar flips around December 7. The Committee to Restore Rational Top Ten List Practices would like you to call this toll free number. For only pennies a day, the price of a cup of coffee, rappers like Ghostface can have new hope and a Banana Nutriment. Please, make a difference in the life of someone special.

When a consumer files a CSPA case, he's not just acting for himself. He steps into the shoes of the attorney general, acting on behalf of all consumers. He can only sue for monetary damages on his own behalf, but if he prevails, he can use his case to have a practice declared unfair or ask the court to prohibit the cheating company from mistreating other customers in the future.
Pancetta can be eaten thinly sliced and raw, similar to prosciutto, but more often it is cooked, which gives it an intensely savory flavor. Think of it as maxed out bacon.

Sandwiches were generally disappointing, and I think the weak bread is to blame. This was true of the grilled cheese and a Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Even the famous cheese toast that Cafe Hon serves its egg salad sandwich on is dry and airy. The best sandwich is the Reuben, which Cafe Hon actually grills instead of throwing under some heat.
Drones come in a variety of sizes, ranging from large aircraft with 116-foot wingspans to tiny craft that can weigh less than an ounce. Under the new FAA rules, civilian drones must weigh less than 55 pounds, stay below an altitude of 400 feet and remain within sight of their operators.

Green apple, poppy seed, grated lemon, morning bun and chalky mineral flavors mesh perfectly.
The ML seats five comfortably; drivers with more passengers than cargo will have to wait until the 2013 model year, when Mercedes will offer it with seven seats. For now, the cargo space is average for this segment, though the rear seats fold completely flat if needed.
Almost forgotten after the sellout crowd calmed down was that the Blues increased their NHL-best point total to 105, staying two ahead of the New York Rangers, who won Tuesday. The Blues put more separation between them and Vancouver, No. 2 in the West with 101 points. They also added distance from Detroit and Nashville, Nos. 2-3 in the Central Division with 97 and 96 points, respectively.

When we've tried to take this series of bumps in the past at higher speeds (above 20 mph) in the regular TRD Tacoma, the results were both jarring and unnerving. It was easy to tell we were running outside the suspension setup's capabilities. However, when trying the same section in the Baja Series, the shocks made all the difference. At 20, 30 and 40 mph, the series of ruts and bumps felt like they were getting smoother. In high-range four-wheel drive, we found the best way to keep control of the Tacoma was to keep the revs high (around 3,000 or 4,000 rpm) in 2nd or 3rd gear (depending on speed) and aim for the tops of the whoops. In fact, after just a short amount of time, it was clear from the feel of the truck that it could do higher speeds as well, which we did.
Feldman: I'm not sure thinking about growth in philanthropy is realistic. So we're thinking a lot more about how to become more self-sufficient and to earn more of our money. Things like the global internet provide opportunities to do that.
Real Madrid could well have lost at Camp Nou and still won La Liga. But actually defeating its eternal rival is something of a game-changer. Mourinho may not admit it, but he didn't just get a monkey off his back, he banished a whole pack of screaming orangutans.

Between 1990 and 2007, when U.S. maritime trade peaked as the recession took hold, there was a fourfold increase in containerized trade through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. In the process, the two San Pedro Bay ports became the nation's busiest maritime gateway. Container traffic through the Port of Oakland, meanwhile, more than doubled.
Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell and his staff. The Giants played exclusively in the nickel Sunday. They switched up the personnel a bit to freshen it up, but they had five DBs on the field for every single play except one, by my count. The loss of middle LB Jonathan Goff has forced Fewell to play mostly nickel this season. But to do it exclusively and to play so well on defense against the Pats for much of the game is a credit to the scheme, the coaches and the players.
Youngblood, who didn't score in the triple jump on Thursday, scored five points for fourth place in the long jump. She got her best jump on her fifth attempt, with a mark of 21-3 1/4.

"I'm drawn to public service," said Bush, who lives in Fort Worth. "Given the opportunity and the stars align, I'd definitely like to consider it. But nothing's on the table right now." Bush said he's "more drawn to state government," with a particular interest in education and "making our taxpayer dollars more accountable to the end user, which is the state taxpayer."
"A woman writer is 'rowing against wind and tide,'" Anne Morrow Lindbergh told her daughter Reeve in 1972, quoting Harriet Beecher Stowe. "We cannot — or only with the greatest difficulty — produce a great 'body of work.'… And it isn't just being a woman. It is some other deeper conflict between art and life." Ultimately, Lindbergh made art from her life; this posthumous collection joins five earlier volumes of diaries and correspondence that explore her experiences with the subtlety and drama of a good novel.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.
In better times, they've offered a flying car, a submarine, a custom-fitted medieval suit of armor and even an adult-size mermaid suit.

Most cities renew their contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department yearly. When the 2013 contracts come up, county officials will ask for no less than a five-year commitment from its 12 contract cities.

We make little coats and leggings out of the blankets."
Beyond the theoretical solutions, the reality on the snow has been gruesome. At Tahoe's Alpine Meadows during the Christmas-New Year holidays, a snowboarder, 25, was found dead in a tree well in wilderness adjacent to the resort. In Wyoming, also during the holidays, a 22-year-old snowboarder crashed into a mother and her 5-year-old daughter who were stopped on a hill, killing himself and the girl. The latest fatal accident occurred Saturday at Granlibakken, a small North Tahoe resort, where a 22-year-old snowboarder from Oakland, Rahsheka Keith, reportedly tried to use her board as a sled, became turned around and rammed into the support pole of a lift tower.
Even so, the mystery has lost none of its allure, consuming marine architects and amateur sleuths alike for decades. Philip Sims, a former U.S. Navy marine architect, says Ballard and his team's discovery opened up "the whole ocean of undersea wrecks," particularly because of revolutionary deep-sea technology. Sims will be a speaker today at the International Marine Forensics Symposium in National Harbor, Md., where attendees will revisit the sinking of Titanic and other famed ships.

In case you've jumped to the conclusion that Pizzeria Ortica may have been inspired by Pizzeria Mozza, I'd say you're probably right. What chef wouldn't want to emulate the success of the Silverton-Batali juggernaut? But Pizzeria Ortica is not a carbon copy. For one thing, the menu includes pasta, some of the best in Southern California, plus a fine antipasti and salad menu, and a handful of well-conceived main courses.
Environmental groups had pushed for curbs on greenhouse gas emissions, blamed for global warming, and challenged the Bush administration for blocking a waiver request from California to pursue more stringent air pollution rules than required by the federal government. The request was granted by the Obama administration last year.
Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.
Raising the direst alarm yet, his administration warned fellow Democrats on Wednesday that if they defeat the tax plan, they could jolt the nation back into recession.

In the near future, science develops a way to make people stop aging at 25. Pretty sweet, except that everyone is also genetically engineered to only live one more year. They can buy more time, allowing the rich go on living at 25 indefinably, while everyone else's clock runs out. Justin Timberlake plays a man accused of murder, who then sets out to shake up the system, with a hostage Amanda Seyfried in tow. Though, pretty sure Timberlake turned 30 this year...
Elmer used a restaurant-quality raspberry jam for the filling, but you can use seedless raspberry jam from the grocery store. Put it in a bowl and whip it up a bit for easy spreading, and spread all the way to the edge of the cake layers.
James Kvaal, the campaign’s policy director, also dismissed Romney’s contention that getting government out of the way by cutting taxes, spending and regulations would spur job creation. “Efforts to cut our way to prosperity have been tried in the past, and Gov.

“We felt that today’s deal provided us the opportunity to acquire several players that are at or near Major League ready and we could control for five to six years, all of whom have upside potential,” Zduriencik said. “We believe it improves the construction of our Major League roster by adding a right-handed bat and a left-handed arm immediately, and thanks to the young arms we have in our minor league system, we believe that we were able to add talent to our organization while dealing from an area of depth.
While hanging around North Beach and contemplating his future, Bittner, inspired by the eco-friendly writings of Gary Snyder, took to bird-watching. He soon focused his attention on his neighborhood's flock of cherry-headed conures (also known as red-masked parakeets), birds native to South America that either got away from, or were rejected by, their local owners, or escaped during shipment to pet stores. After a long period of patiently building trust, Bittner bonded with the animals, and the results, as captured by filmmaker Judy Irving, are fun to watch. The parrots not only eat out of Bittner's hands, but perch on his shoulders and head as he addresses them by name. Bittner got to know his feathered friends so well that he could recognize individuals, and he happily recounts their stories.
That compared with a surplus of $5.35 billion in March and a deficit of $31.5 billion in February. China often has a large trade deficit early in the year as factories restock after their long lunar new year holiday break.
But when Fedorko himself was later asked the same question, he had a different response.

“We are sworn to secrecy,” he said Tuesday morning. “We had a brief conversation last night, and we will talk about it in caucus. So, we will see. I am not going to talk about it.”
Freddy's dead.
He was appointed to the Ward B seat on April 6 after Councilwoman Mary Spinello resigned, just weeks before the May 12 election. She had left to head the Jersey City Parking Authority, and the council voted to replace her for the short stretch in what some deemed an inappropriate attempt to give Kenny the "incumbent'' advantage come Election Day.
"The city has done a very good job in meeting the requirements of the consent decrees," Bethea said Monday. She noted that the city has a plan to reduce the volume of sewage spills by 99 percent, compared to when the consent decree took affect, by the original 2014 deadline.

The Thunder didn't immediately announce whether Harden, who scored 14 points, had a concussion. Bryant and other Lakers acknowledged World Peace is likely to face a multigame suspension with just one game left in their regular season.
But the rule can -- and should -- be your law in your car. Ask back-seat passengers to lock in those seat belts before starting a trip. Far too few of us do that. The LeaseTrader survey indicated only 2 percent of drivers routinely make the safety request over their shoulder. Less than 8 percent ask even half of the time.
“This is an outstanding facility, absolutely outstanding,” Coughlin said. “What I like about it is that the college teams here have been working all fall, so the turf has been broken in well. It’s settled in, and it’s in great shape. It’s going to be great for our players to work out in here all week.”
The late surge before the caucuses for Santorum was the first exhibit, Crawford said. Since then, Republicans elected no self-identified Romney supporters to the Iowa GOP state central committee, Ron Paul backers made a successful play to gain ground within the party structure, the two national committee representatives and state chair refused to sign a delegate loyalty pledge, the party booked a fundraising keynote speaker who has said he?s not enthused about Romney, and various outspoken activists have expressed their reluctance about him.
"Ninety-five percent of employees, contrary to popular belief, do their job," said Pagnotta-Murphy, who supervises a small team that maintains city vehicles.
Why do we think Crosby's peeps are behind this? The item reads: "'She is heartbroken, but she is already writing great songs about it,' the pal says. The singer will keep herself busy with an upcoming tour to promote her album Flawz, the friend notes." Way to stay on message.
At a sidewalk picnic table, I talked beer with 5Q regulars Zach Christensen and Heidi Leibbrandt, who make their own brew and grow hops at their nearby home. Christensen, who's "in telecom," nursed a pint of Lompoc's C-Note pale ale, brewed with seven hops that start with "C" (Crystal, Cluster, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Columbus and Challenger). It rates a chart-topping 100 International Bitterness Units, a measure of hop infusion, which Portland beer geeks bandy about the way wine fans talk about grippy tannins.
The airport is also seeking to attract more carriers. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors authorized a $250,000 cash offer to Virgin America to lure it to Sacramento. That money would come from an existing program funded by airport restaurants and shops.
If the deal with Dawson is finalized, it could be a good first step in reorganizing the company, city officials said.

"What I didn't know was how to be of use to other people. We don't innately know how we can be of use and who we are inside when we're young. We're basically straddling fences when we're young and searching."
"Black Watch," the National Theatre of Scotland's celebrated Iraq war drama, is coming to the Bay Area in a rare off-site presentation as part of the American Conservatory Theater's 2012-13 season.
Quigley said she may run for a political office in two years, though not necessarily in the Legislature. “I don’t think it’s unfair,” she said. “I think it’s unfortunate.”
Lake Oswego: The Lake Oswego School District plans to pay $1.34 million to settle litigation involving a 2010 repair project at Lake Oswego High School that kept students out of the main entrance and library during the beginning of the school year.
"Ramble At The Ryman"
What advice would you give incoming freshmen? That they should get involved. Getting involved with the things that interest a student will teach him far more than a classroom ever could. I would also tell students to follow their hearts and their passions and that everything else will fall into place. Finally, take every opportunity that is afforded, as one does not know where these opportunities will lead.
And at some point in 2012, he will take them to Baltimore.
Kimbrough traveled to more than 40 countries. After meeting several women in Nigeria who were struggling to help children with developmental disabilities, she helped start an educational center for children there. She was an avid photographer, sang in her church choir and was a southern-style cook. She had an impressive collection of African art.
"Mitt Romney drew more young voters in Florida than in 2008, but the low turnout still raises questions about his appeal to youth," the center's director, Peter Levine, said in a prepared statement.
The governor tried to raise the cigarette tax before, as did his predecessor, Rod Blagojevich. The two most recent proposals passed in the Illinois Senate but died in the House. The cigarette tax was last increased in 2002, from 58 cents to 98 cents, under Republican Gov. George Ryan.
If swing voters ask that question, and vote accordingly, Romney may find that his primary season Achilles heel has become his saving grace. And Obama may find that his presumptuous promises of second-term flexibility never come to pass.
Ours is one of the few states that are home to more than one climate zone. Deserts cover 30 percent of the land, grassland and steppes spread over 53 percent and the highlands make up 17 percent.
Will Romine walked directly over to Jazzy and rubbed her wavy black hair. The third-year law student was making a repeat visit to play with the dogs.
New England traded up twice in the first round on Thursday to select defensive end Chandler Jones of Syracuse at No. 21, and linebacker Dont'a Hightower of Alabama at No. 25.
Heyman's skill at guiding a complex institution in an often heated political atmosphere led to his selection as the Smithsonian's 10th secretary, or director, in 1994.
The Institute for Supply Management's better-than-expected report, improving manufacturing data overseas and a surprise jump in U.S. construction spending in June, helped push stock markets higher. Following last week's report that the U.S. economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter, many economists believe the longest recession since World War II may be over, though any recovery will be subdued.
"It's going to take years," Jim Farley, Ford's global marketing chief said at an event at the IAC Building in New York City Monday night. "But the whole idea is that the company that made the same commitment to the Ford brand is now making that commitment to Lincoln for exclusive product where the customer gets a world class product."
6 / Ramona (II) / 14-5-1
WR David Tyree said he realizes Thursday "could" be his last game as a Giant, but said that's an "exciting" scenario. Exciting because he feels like a rookie again?
5 TBB BOGEY CLUB LANE $337,000
The newspaper found the agency — which treats the sewage of more than 1.3 million people in Essex, Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties — was being used by its commissioners as a private piggy bank, hiring wives, brothers, in-laws and children; approving special-interest contracts; and hiring of politically connected officials at six-figure salaries.
Kim was not eligible for the Masters. He is not exempt for the U.S. Open. Tuesday was the first time he hit balls since he withdrew from the Texas Open. After one swing, he clutched his right elbow. There was a duck-hook with the driver, another shot that resembled a shank. The other shots were mostly good, though Kim said he still feels a jolt in his elbow even after hitting wedges.
The many theorists out there who believe Cuomo wants President Obama to lose in November in order to abet his own presidential aspirations will find support on Page 25 of the speech, where, when noting the new federal health-care law should cut some insurance costs in New York, the governor failed to give Obama any credit for his signature plan.
A former pilot for Delta Air Lines, Montague spent 15 years flying Asian routes out of Portland until they were canceled. He also flew occasionally to Honolulu from Atlanta but has been to Maui only once.
But he also has had a few missteps that have drawn the ire of Jewish groups, most notably in 2009 when he lifted the excommunication of a traditionalist Catholic bishop who had denied the extent of the Holocaust by saying no Jews were gassed during World War II.
Blagojevich will be retried next year on federal charges that he schemed to sell the seat after his first trial ended in a mistrial. Emanuel was not called to testify and hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing.
We would find such things silly. But, suddenly, when it comes to relationships in general, and marriage in particular, we get scared off by the work involved.
If we don't start using our own resources and stop trying to be the hero of global warming, we forever will be dependent on other countries for our energy needs. It's time for congressional leaders to stop the EPA from destroying our country from within.
That's a tiny number in relative terms, and the Snake River fish still have to make it to their home lakes in central Idaho. But it's the highest sockeye return recorded at Lower Granite since it was built in 1975, and nearly 25 times the average return of the last 10 years. Ten years ago two sockeye came back.
In an email Tuesday, the Maryland Democratic Party accused Romney of wanting to "go back to the same economic policies that got us into this mess in the first place." Southern Maryland Rep. Steny H.

Then, in exchange for political contributions and kickbacks, Salahuddin steered contracts to Mazzocchi and Cooper, prosecutors said.
It is a conundrum, at least to anyone who’s never been religious: The person who is beginning to doubt their faith, and so prays to a God they’re no longer sure of to have that faith restored.
Medco shareholders would receive $71.36 per share in cash and stock, or $29.1 billion, based on the stock's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange when the merger was announced last July 21. Shareholders of Medco would receive $28.80 in cash and 0.81 shares for each Medco share they own upon closing of the transaction.
Yet the shareholders have left many bills unpaid. Sandvick says Macron owes him more than $34,000, and nobody from the building's ownership group paid for permits based on his renovation plans. Macron also owes more than $105,000 in fines levied by the Cleveland Housing Court, related to building code violations.
The runner-up Butler Bulldogs forgot their lines when cast as the Hickory Huskers of "Hoosiers." Jimmy Chitwood didn't come back to the team, bringing his velvety shooting touch with him. No one did.
Disorderly conduct. An 18-year-old Shakopee man was cited for disorderly conduct and arrested on an outstanding Scott County warrant, a 20-year-old Shakopee man was cited for disorderly conduct, a 17-year-old Shakopee boy was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia and arrested on an outstanding Scott County warrant, and a 19-year-old Shakopee man was arrested on an outstanding Scott County warrant after a fight near the intersection of 6th Avenue W. and S.
